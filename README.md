## Project Description

**Summer weddings** are in full swing!! To help make wedding planning easier, we would like to develop a _wedding planner web application_ that will help any wedding planner easily plan and organize all the details surrounding the big day. This application will allow users to create a profile under which they can create **one** or **more** wedding event plans.

## User Stories

```
AS a wedding planner
I WANT to be able to use an online web application
SO THAT I can better plan an awesome wedding
```

---

## Concept

This platform is a full stack web application that will allow a wedding planner to `plan` and `manage` a clientâ€™s wedding. Weddings are significant events in people's lives and as such, couples are often willing to spend considerable amount of money to ensure that their weddings are well-organized. The Wedding Planner application allows the user to keep all guests, invitations, venue information, and more in one place.

### Design

This section addresses the platforms's basic functionality and style/design utilized for the multiple features included thorughout the site.

#### Architecture

This project is based on **MVC design** (_model-view-control_), which facilitates a better organization pattern for the code used to develop this web application. The MVC folder pattern helps separate the application's care back-end business logic, front-end UI design, and user interaction. The diagram included below outlines the architecture of this web application.

##### ER Diagram

The entity relationship (ER) diagram below provides a visual representation of how the data is saved inside the application's back-end database. This diagram also demonstrates the relationship between each database table.

<img src="readme/imgs/schema.png" width = "600px">

#### APIs Docs

In order to access the API data, we recommend using **Postman**, which is a REST API GUI client that you can download onto your local environment from the [Postman website](https://www.postman.com/). Please reference this [APIs Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11452429/T1LHHA3X) for details on the first steps users need to following in order to this applications **APIs**.

When referencing the provided API documentation, consider accessing Postman by clicking on the a _Run_ in _Postman_ button as demonstrated in the photo below. If you have your API endpoints integrated with Postman, you can export your Postman collections as a widget to embed in an HTML page.
